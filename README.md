# Works-of-Architecture-scraping-and-plotting
scraping and plotting program using selenium and folium, the Archinform website, google maps and google images
Hi, this is one of the first projects.
It is meant to scrape from the Archinform website all the architectural works information of a specific city, and then use google maps and google images to get the relevant coordinates and images.
It then uses folium to plot the markers on a map of that city.
The program has thre main problems: the first is that I cannot automate accepting cookies from Google Maps, but have to accept them manually every time google maps is opened. Secondly the program uses bots to get the necessary information,
hence it is quite slow, and it frequently crashes due to slow connection (the driver is asked to retrieve html before the latter has loaded).
Peer review and any advice is more than welcome. 
Any advice on what else to do is also welcome.
